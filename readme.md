# Reconstructing Cave Story

I try to follow along with Reconstructing Cave Story, except I try to do it in
Livescript with Canvas instead of SDL. I have no idea whether the browser is up
to it using C++-oriented game design techniques, but let's see.


# Progress

Currently up to: Episode 6


# Usage

To run it, go to project directory and run `gulp`. This will start a server on
`localhost:8080` (unless you change stuff). Visit this in your browser to play
the game.
