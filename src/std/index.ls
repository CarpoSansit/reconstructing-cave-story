# This is mainly a thin wrapper around prelude, but we will also provide
# a bunch of other helper functions and stuff here as we accumulate them.


# Get the functions we want out of Prelude

# Custom helpers

export log  = -> console.log.apply  console, &; &0

export round = Math.round
export max   = Math.max
export min   = Math.min

# Export

export {
  # Specified Prelude functions only
  id, any, map, filter,

  # Enum helper - assign sequential integers using destructuring syntax
  enum: [ 0 to 20 ]
